detect loop in a linked list


how does the loop look like in linked list??



                          --->4 ---->5 ----> 6 ----> 7--->
head ---> 1 ---> 2 ---> 3                                  8 
                          <---12 <---11 <---10  <--9 <---


above example is linked list but its consider to be linked list having loop 
the reason is because the element 3 can be accesed by the address stored at node 2 and address stored at node
 12 also , so this linked list doesnot have element pointing to null
